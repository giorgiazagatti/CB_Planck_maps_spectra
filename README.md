# Repository Overview

This repository contains the data and findings from the study:

*Cosmic Birefringence and its cross-correlation with CMB from Planck data*  
G. Zagatti et al.

## Contents

- **CB_spectra**: This folder contains the Cosmic Birefringence (CB) power spectra, evaluated from Planck PR3 and NPIPE data products. These spectra are computed for each multipole L, ranging from L=0 to L=1500. We provide CB spectra estimated for full mission data products, and for the different combinations of data splits (e.g., HM1xHM1, HM2xHM2 for Planck PR3, and AxA, BxB, AxB for Planck NPIPE). The data are in $deg^2$.

- **cross_corr_spectra**: Here, you'll find the power spectra of the cross-correlations between the CB field and the CMB T-, E-, and B-fields. These are computed up to L=1500 for both Planck PR3 and NPIPE, with the power spectra binned with 100 multipoles per bin. The cross-spectra are provided both in $C_\ell$'s and in $D_\ell$'s, and are in $deg \cdot \mu K$.

## Additional Information

Upon reasonable requests, we can provide additional products such as CB maps or the spherical harmonic coefficients of the CB field.
